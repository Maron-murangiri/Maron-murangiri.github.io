 **System Hardening**: Reducing attack surfaces through least-privilege access and tamper-proof logging  
 **Policy Framework**: Essential guidelines for BYOD, data protection, and disaster recovery  
 **Incident Response**: Importance of CSIRT teams and risk assessment matrices  
 **Security Standards**: Leveraging ISO 27001, NIST, and OWASP frameworks  

#### Critical Questions Addressed:
1. Are employees trained to recognize social engineering attacks?  
2. Is our infrastructure hardened against insider/outsider threats?  
3. Do cybersecurity policies cover all operational risks?  
4. How robust is our incident response plan?  

#### Practical Recommendations:
- Balance investment in tech, processes, *and* employee training  
- Implement international security standards as baseline controls  
- Adopt threat modeling techniques (Attack Trees, Kill Chain)
